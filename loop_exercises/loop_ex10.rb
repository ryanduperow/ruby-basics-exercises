# Your friends just showed up! Given the following array of names, use a for loop to greet each friend individually:

friends = ['Sarah', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Dave']

for friend in friends                           # assign variable to 'friend' to account for each individual in 'friends' array
    puts "Hello, #{friend}!"
