puts a  # prints 3

# Notes:
# We are now dealing with a method invocation that has a block. 
# The scoping rules for a method invocation with a block differ from the rules for method definitions. 
# With method definitions, local variable scope is restricted to the method definition itself. 
# In contrast, a method invocation with a block has more open scoping rules; ...
# the block can use and modify local variables that are defined outside the block.

# In this case, a starts out as 7, then we set a to 1, 2 and 3 in sequence. 
# By the time we get to the puts, a has a value of 3.
