# What will the following code print?

a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |a|
  a += 1
end

puts a      # prints 7

# Notes:
# This problem demonstrates shadowing. Shadowing occurs when a block argument hides a local variable that is defined...
# outside the block. Since the outer a is shadowed, the a += 1 has no effect on it. In fact, that statement has no effect at all.
